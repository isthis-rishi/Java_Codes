## Subarray Printer in Java

The `allSubArray` class provides a static method `printAllSubArrays` which, given an array of integers, prints out all possible subarrays. This can be useful for various algorithmic problems that require processing all subsegments of an array.

### Usage

Simply call the `printAllSubArrays` method with the array you want to process: [allSubArray](https://github.com/isthis-rishi/Java_Codes/blob/main/Java%20Codes/allSubArray.java)

## Calculating Subarray Sums in Java

When working with arrays in Java, a common task is to calculate the sum of all possible subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array. The sum of a subarray is simply the total of its elements.

### Conceptual Approach

The process to calculate the sum of all subarrays involves iterating through the array and considering every possible subarray. For each starting index, we explore all ending indices that form a subarray and calculate their sums.

### Steps to Calculate Subarray Sums

1. **Initialize**: Begin with two indices, `i` and `j`, which will represent the current subarray's bounds.
2. **Iterate Over Start Points**: Loop through the array with `i` ranging from the first to the last element.
3. **Iterate Over End Points**: For each `i`, loop with `j` from `i` to the last element.
4. **Calculate Sum**: For each pair of `i` and `j`, initialize a sum variable and add each element within the bounds to this sum.
5. **Output Sum**: After calculating the sum for a subarray, output it before moving to the next subarray.

### Considerations

- **Efficiency**: The naive approach has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the triple nested loops required to calculate each subarray's sum. However, this can be optimized to O(n^2) by accumulating the sum as we extend the `j` index.
- **Edge Cases**: Special attention should be given to single-element subarrays and the entire array itself, as these are also valid subarrays.

### Usage Scenarios

This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:
- Analyze sequences within a dataset.
- Perform cumulative sum calculations.
- Solve dynamic programming problems that involve subarray computations.

### Conclusion

Understanding how to calculate subarray sums is a fundamental skill in Java programming. It's a building block for more complex algorithms and is often used in coding interviews and competitive programming.

This explanation provides a conceptual understanding of the task without delving into specific code implementations, where the focus is on the algorithm rather than the code itself.
